For one thing, these kind of strings are not \"fret eaters\" due to their flatwound smooth surface.  Also, they are lots easier on your fingers if you should play that way.  The various tones and behaviors that these strings produce is hard to describe, but it is a situation that very much agrees with me.  You almost have to hear them to really know.  I just got done installing a set of these DR's on a Reverend Thundergun 4 string bass and they sound awesome.  It might be noted that this bass has a 34\" scale neck and string through bridge.  I had no problems with installation or in tuning.  I am pretty much committed to these style of bass strings.  However a word of caution here.  These strings are not supposed to fit long scaled necks.  I shall conclude this review with 6 pictures.  5 stars on these strings for dang sure :)\n",

Kolstein is very sticky and there is almost no powder at all. There is something special in their formulation. I believe Kolstein includes wax in their rosin recipe, which keeps dust from forming. The other benefit of Kolstein is that it lasts for a very long time on the shelf. Pop's will dry out in less than 2 years. Some people will only use Pop's for a few months before throwing it away.

I paired these with a Fender tweed strap, but maybe it is a little bit of overkill having the F sign everywhere (\"Ok ok we KNOW it is a Fender, come on!\"). They are kind of massive when installed, doesn't look bad but just bulky. Only problem I had is that I had previously installed a set of Dunlop straplocks, and when substituting them for these, the new Fender screw fell kind of short, and never got tight, they always stayed turning around when screwing them. So I had to use the previous Dunlop screws with the new Fender ones, and it worked like a charm. Not a problem of the product, but if one has used something else before, one might have these kinds of issues later. Not as easy to lock into the guitar as other models, this one requires two fingers to adjust, instead of for instance Dunlops, with just a central button.

Using strap locks, I would prefer if they used a metal part instead of the plastic part. But the separation is a real downer. All they would have to do is sew or use better glue.

Behringer not only got my money, but my respect and gratitude.\n",

With this focusrite scarlett 2i2 Audio Interface that eliminates that requirement as it also doubles as phantom power.  The mic is very clear when using this recording device.  He uses the Magix Music Maker to record his music.  It is excellent and he has not had any issues with it at all.  I asked him if there was anything negative about it and he said all he can think of is how perfect it is.  You can adjuster mic volume, very clear, he has not heard any cut outs.  The only con is if you leave it plugged in to the USB when you are not using it your voice will sound static, but he said its an easy fix you just unplug the USB and plug it back in.

Great if you want to do some recording in an area that is not sound treated that you can't get away with using a condenser microphone in.  It has a lot of character as it's frequency response is far from flat.  Attenuation of the lows and a pretty beefy boost in the presence without going too bright.  It's a bit louder that the Shure sm58, but not hugely.  Still needs quite a bit of preamp, about 70% up on my preamp to remain in unity on my mixer for reasonable recording levels.

I love the Fender Custom Shop 69s, 54s, 57/62s and Fat 50s. I wanted to try something other than Fender this time, so I chose these SSL-1s. So far I think they are absolutely the best single coil pickup I have ever had. Big, full tone with bell-like highs and a clear bottom end.  On a lot of pickups in Strats the neck pickup can sound too quacky, too much twang and it over powers everything else.  These strike a very nice balance with quack and all the other harmonics that are present.  Some other vintage single coils Ive tried have too much chimey-ness in the tone, too much high, drowns out the mids, again these SSL-1s don't do that, even though there is still tons of chimey, bell-like tones, like glass breaking, very brilliant, but its balanced out with the mid and low tones as well.

This is readily available from most any big box hardware store.  I cut the foam about 4\" in length and placed the 2100 in the foam. It fits perfect. I didn't seal the foam, but it is just right and tight in the mount holder. I now have a shock mount that can be used if, and when, I purchase a larger microphone. I have attached a photo.

After troubleshooting, I solder out the tone control and switched it for the volume pot that seemed to be shorted out perhaps from too much heat from the ground soldering on the back from the factory. Everything worked but there was still hum that I eliminated by running it through an effects pedal. The second one worked but had overwhelming static and hum, but it was cheap. I wired bypassing the controls, plugged it into a separate volume pedal and into an amp. It works fine now but with a little hum. I may still use these in the future because they are very inexpensive. I would use a better and more expensive pickups on better quality guitars. In the future, for one of my inexpensive projects, I would probably just order the pickup without the wiring harness and controls. But, rethinking, even buying an output jack and a bit of shielded cable at Radio Shack would have been more expensive in the end. You can't beat the price.\n",

I was skeptical that it would really make much difference, but my feedback problem was solved, and the tone is much warmer and cleaner (the old pickup was just awful). I read comments saying that the green wire goes with the red and the white is hot. Mine came with the red wire as hot, and I didn't change that. It works, and it definitely sounds like a beige pickup is supposed to, so it think you should just trust whatever setup the factory gives you. Also, I know other people explained this, but many said they had to enlarge the pickup hole to accommodate the pickup. You DO NOT.

I use a delay/reverb combo pedal in the effects loop insert and it's as sweet as the larger setups I have in my main music room.  I use this in my office and it's perfect for the space.  I can't believe such vintage tones can come out of a chip-amp that is as small as a stomp pedal.  If you're looking for extremely high gain, try one of the other Hotone amps like the Legacy British Invasion or Purple Wind.\n",

My Session kit came with them and with the heavy 6 play maple toms have never had a single issue with tuning, bouncing, lug stress whatsoever.  I think after you use them for a while you can take them for granted and don't fully understand how sturdy they are until you use another suspension system.  I recently purchased a Pearl Birch Vision kit for my wife which came with Pearl's I.S.S. mounting system.  To be fair I've never used them, and in the case of the new kit they came right off, and the Optimounts went right on.  Even though these are not the aluminum (more expensive and slightly lighter) Masterworks version, I feel they not only work for what they're intended, but they also accent the drum shells without being intrusive.  Most drummers buy, skin, and play for sound, but showing off your nice wood shells never hurts.  I can't think of a single negative, except that they're not free.  :)\n",

I also own a Scarlet 2i2 (Gen 1)  which I use in my primary studio  I find the 2i2 has superior sound quality  less audible distortion / lower noise  and I prefer the 2i2's Neutrik style XLR/TRS output connector. The Behringer is a good value  it works fine and has good features / performance for the price  but like other Behringer products I've used, the sound quality / noise / distortion, leave me wanting a better product. If features or budget are at the top of your list, this product should do the job; if however sound quality is of primary importance then I'd recommend the Scarlet 2i2 (look for sales or a used Gen 1).\n",

It is heavier duty than my speaker stands and the legs when fully opened will stabilize the biggest  monitor you reasonable would put on a VESA mount that size. The small 17\" one I have on it solid. It is hard to tell in the photo but the mic holders do have a slot on the side so wired as well as wireless mikes can slip in, you'll want to use a round head Shure 58 or equivalent so it doesn't fall through.

Checking Amazon, I saw this stand, which at the time of my order was $20.00 even.  It seemed like a great value, so I ordered it.  The packaging was a little flimsy, but the stand arrived in one piece and in good condition.  It fit my Gaia perfectly.  The included straps don't work with the Gaia, but the stand holds the keyboard well, and at the right height.  It's a little beefier than stands in that price range, though not as beefy as my 2 tier stand, though that was much more expensive.  This is totally a five star stand at the price I paid, and even at $5.00 more at the time of this review.  For an inexpensive stand, I don't think anyone can do better.  Recommended.\n",

I tried adding additional Velcro, but that didn't stop it.  But now, with the Pearl Pedal Stabilizer on the front of it, it stays put.  The Pearl's long spikes go deep into my old oriental carpet that I use as my drum rug at a perfect angle to restrict any forward movement.  Now I can really kick it hard!

I tested several guitars because I wanted a nice kick back acoustic that covered all the base and mids I remember from the Martin coffee house days. I did not like the new guitars, they did not sound the way I remember them. I walked out of my favorite music stores with out any guitar. My friend told me to try a Canadian made guitar a Seagull. I never heard of them. I saw a few for sale used, that's good because I wanted an old one. I tested a 1996 S6 Seagull and the sound, power and tone from this guitar was fantastic. I bought it, set the action very low and put some #9 strings one it. This cedar top has a magic to it and I am pleased with this one. Just as fine to play as the crazy priced guitars.\n",

The AC plug that goes into the wall or power strip is not designed for standard outlets found in the United States.  While this is not an inherent flaw, it is not stated clearly enough in the item description and I do not believe it can be seen in the photos.  JOYO does include a 2-prong adapter for use in the United States.  The adapter is much smaller than the power supply itself, which leaves the bottom of the power supply resting 1-5/8\" away from the outlet (see attached photo).  There simply doesn't seem to be enough surface contact between the base of the power supply and the outlet.  A few trips over the power cord could easily compromise the integrity of the adapter, AC plug and/or your outlet.  I have not yet decided whether or not to keep this.\n",

            "(Review is based on using it with the PYLE PSMRS11 Acoustic Isolation Microphone shield, you can buy it as a package. I bought mine separately) It is one heavy duty mic stand, but I got it for holding up the PYLE PSMRS11 Acoustic Isolation Microphone shield and the damn shield was too heavy to hold in place!  It kept falling over. This mic stand was sold to hold the darn thing but it only works if you place the Isolation Shield in a certain direction (see picture). You must remove the rubber pads that are on the Microphone shield, if you don't you'll find your Isolation shield on the floor! The weight is too heavy for the rubber pads to hold them up (they are glued on). So you have to tighten metal to metal to hold the shield in place. You have to constantly check the tightening supports to make sure they don't pull the support stand down with it! You also have to remove the bottom metal desk supports from the Mic Shield to lighten the load on the Mic Stand. I hope this helps everyone using this for a Mic Shield.\n",

As some other reviewers have commented this bass is not balanced as a standard solid body bass. the neck is definitely heavier due to the hollow body, but you know, that's the way it goes. I love the sound the hollow body gives you sounds a bit like my acoustic bass. The controls give a nice variety of sounds. I am something of a novice player but wanted to add a hollow body bass to my small collection and this Hofner replica is just the ticket. I think I might replace the strings that it came with as they sound a too metallic for my taste, but they are playable and hold tune well. I was able to play this bass right out of the box once I tuned it. No need for adjusting and didn't have that fret buss some reviewers have commented on. I did notice the neck is slimmer and the strings are closer together than any of my other basses, so that is an adjustment, but didn't take long to get into the swing of things.

With no change other than plugging in the Shure Super 55, adjust input trim on mixer and some minor EQ, the difference in her voice was remarkable. Very even and consistent response across vocal frequency range. Some presence enhancement,  subtle and helps vocals punch through mix. Another reviewer mentioned the Shure Super 55 may have some compression characteristics -- I agree and it's a good thing; she is able to get right up to the mic, soft or screaming, it doesn't peg the meter (much) on my board. Another thing is that she *loves* the look of the Super 55 Deluxe; puts her in the mood for that 40's/50's jazz stuff she does so well :) Overall - we are very happy with the Super 55 Deluxe and I will probably get a second one for myself soon.\n",

I got a little creative with the install, attaching all eight leather straps around the circumference of the drum and weaving the rubber cord (full length) back and forth around the Shu (see photos). I used the May no-drill vent hole mic cable adapter to wire it up. I'm very pleased with the design and quality of the Kelly Shu.

Of course, everything is based on taste and the kind of music you play.  This is not a super scooped metal pedal.  It's best for strong overdrives and smooth grudge sounds.  The big factor about this pedal compared to more expensive pedals is that it doesn't like HEAT.  I had a gig in Detroit on a metal stage with a 100 degree PLUS day.  The pedal didn't like it at all.  My BOSS Blues driver was just fine.  Of course the Blues Driver is a $100 pedal. It took the temps just fine. So, that is, in my opinion, the big difference between what you get with JOYO vs other, more expensive, pedals.  Keep in mind, if you are not playing in 100 degree temperatures you have nothing to fear. So, rock on and enjoy your music!!\n",

The unit is dead quiet, the only noise noted was when I tightened up the bandwidth and boosted level into the upper 3rd of its range on the parametric eq. In microphone applications the unit performs equally well and the low cut worked great for reduction of handling noise. This is a fantastic tool at a bargain price. I own an ART tube MP preamp also and this unit is definitely a solid step up from the MP. Thanks to Behringer for making great quality affordable products for musicians on a budget. The only knock I can come up with at this point is that the manual is extremely basic and if you're a new user of mic pre's you're kind of on your own.

            "This pickup has a great, traditional, single coil strat sound. I'm really pleased with the sweet clear tone this delivers. You can make it scream with your amp setting if that's what you want. It's really great looking, too! I had no issues at all with the soldering connections, and the volume and tone pots work well as does the jack. I used this on a cigar box guitar build, and I love the tone! This homemade CBG sounds like a legitimate strat. I would definitely use this pickup again in the future, and I have no doubt it would sound good to swap out the pups on a cheapo commercial strat with these. My only complaint, and it's a small one, is that the knobs included had a tiny bit of smearing on the gold paint. It's not a big deal because many pups don't include knobs at all, and there are so many knob options available at very affordable prices. I actually used the knobs anyway, so I'm not going to knock a star off for that. The tone and looks of the pickup are fantastic at this price!\n",

This strap is only 3/8\" inch wide, but my ukulele is so lightweight that I really don't need anything wider and a narrower strap doesn't get in the way of my arms and hands. Installing this strap without removing my ukulele strings took some effort. I had to unthread the strap loop (which is really much tighter than it needs to be), then thread the strap end under my ukulele strings, then thread it back through the strap loop (which is still much tighter than it needs to be). The plastic buckle in the middle of the strap is not removable, so you need to thread that through strap loop and it is a real tight fit. Once installed, the strap works great. The thin soft-ish cotton is more comfortable on my shoulder than thick leather or stiff nylon strap and it doesn't seem to scratch my ukulele wood at all.\n",

            "this amp is the real deal . great crunch and gain tones and with some tweaking , not half bad clean '' ish '' tones . i 've played this through the two 8 '' orange cabs ( had to get those too as they were just too cool ( ( and cute ) ) and not crazy money ) and the sound is very pleasing and revealing for a practice amp . i primarily play it through my blackstar stack that i 've fitted with celestion v30s ... wow ... there it is~ ! ! ! you would never know this thing was such a tone monster ... even with just a few knobs it 's easy to get lost for hours playing this thing . my favorite match is with my chapman ml-1 hotrod ... which only has a volume `` tone '' control ( evh fans get this ) . not a lot of mucking around with too many knobs or too many options on either the guitar or this amp ... just tone up and go . i see the micro dark just came out ... that 's probably next~ ! higher gain , buffered effects loop and speaker emu at the headphone out for recording direct ( if that 's your thing ) .\n",
            "---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "you can do a lot with this mixer . its great for podcasting . has 4 outputs that can be used to monitor , record , cue audio ... the mute to 3/4 figure on every channel is fantastic and the three source switch to headphone/control room is a must for podcasting . also has aux return inputs that can be used as extra stereo inputs and be volumed by the aux return knobs . only thing i did n't like about this mixer is the xlr outputs in back that require adaptors to use with rca or 1/4 plugs . get the adaptors with it\n",
            "---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "this mic is a boss and a lot better than just about any other mic i 've seen or used out-of-the-box for voice over . it sounds great even before processing , and with some compression and eq , it sounds fantastic . it rejects a ton of background noise and sounds amazing . it runs very hot ! so you 'll want clean pre-amping as to get a clean signal , but this is an amazing mic for the price .\n",
